✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, Smart Monorepos · Fast CI.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

## Integrate with editors

Enhance your Nx experience by installing [Nx Console](https://nx.dev/nx-console) for your favorite editor. Nx Console
provides an interactive UI to view your projects, run tasks, generate code, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and
comes with a LSP for Vim users.


## Build for production

Run `npx nx build backend` to build the application. The build artifacts are stored in the output directory (e.g. `dist/` or `build/`), ready to be deployed.

## Getting started

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) . A simple `pnpm install` in the root directory will install all dependencies.

Each app can be started with `pnpm dev:<appName>` .This will start the app in development mode.

# @app/source

This repository contains the source code for the frontend and backend applications of the "@app/source" project.

## Frontend

The frontend application is responsible for the user interface and client-side functionality.

### Technologies Used:

- React
- React Router
- Redux Toolkit
- React Hook Form
- Tailwind CSS
- Radix UI
- Framer Motion
- React Toastify
- Storybook

### Scripts:

- `dev:frontend`: Start the development server for the frontend application.
- `sb`: Run Storybook for component development.

## Backend

The backend application provides server-side functionality and interacts with databases.

### Technologies Used:

- Node.js
- Express.js
- Prisma
- JWT for authentication
- Winston for logging

### Scripts:

- `dev:backend`: Start the development server for the backend application.
- `db:generate`: Generate Prisma client.
- `db:start`: Start the Dockerized database.
- `db:clear`: Clear the Dockerized database.
- `db:studio`: Open Prisma Studio.
- `db:push`: Push database changes to the server.

## Development Tools

This project uses Nx for workspace management, which allows for monorepo-style development. Nx provides various plugins for linting, testing, and building applications.

### Nx Plugins Used:

- Nx ESLint: Linting for JavaScript and TypeScript.
- Nx Jest: Testing framework.
- Nx Vite: Build tool for the frontend application.
- Nx Storybook: Component development environment.

### Additional Dependencies:

- Bcrypt for password hashing.
- JSON Web Token (JWT) for authentication.
- Node Schedule for scheduling tasks.
- RSS Parser for parsing RSS feeds.
- Zod for schema validation.

## Development Workflow

To start the development servers for both frontend and backend, run the following commands:

- > dev:`<appname>`
